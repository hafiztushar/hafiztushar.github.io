                    Hi, I'am Hafiz, a student from Islamic University of Technology (IUT). I am in the third year of my Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science and Engineering.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before starting my academic life in IUT, I completed my Junior School Certificate, Secondary School Certificate, Higher Secondary School Certificate from Barisal Cadet College with GPA 5 out of 5.

                <p>
                    During my 3 year journy with CSE I have gather theoretical and application based knowledge about many sectors. Some of those are web architecture and development (html, CSS, PHP, JavaScript,JSP,AJAX,JSON), object oriented programming (C++, Java), structured programming (C) , databse managment system (PL/SQL), data communications(NS-2), algorithms, constrained programming (MiniZinc).    
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently I am doing my undergraduate research in the area of Internet of Things with an intention to make an impact for more secured <br>communication between IoT devices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the same time, to gather more practical knowledge about the environment and activities of an fast growing organization by developing required skills I am looking for an internship oppurtunity.
                    I am available for any full time internship starting from the mid of November, 2019 to through December,2019.
                    Any one interested to give me an oppurtunity are requested to contact me through provided info or mail me at hafiztushar@gmail.com .
